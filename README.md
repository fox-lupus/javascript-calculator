2021/3/10 looked into using keys to be used as input but it but I was not able to understand how to implement it. I have made it work now but its very rough around the edges.

2021/3/1 continuing on working out the logic for the calculator so it acts like one and adding comments on the code i have done so far

2021/2/25 realzed that node.js and react.js are not what I need for this project. I will be using a plain html file for now doing some tests with my ideas. Made a temp files to play around with to get more familiar with javascript. 

2021/2/22 looking into event driven flowchart and a different web development setup using react.js and node.js. I'm also going to give myself a test run and see if i can get a console calculator work just to make sure i understand node.js

2021/2/11 started making project folders, set up a github repo. Planning on using w3 web schools to learn more about javascript. 

2021/2/8 continue to work on flowchart and find a ide for javascript.

Started work on flowchart and planning for javascript calculator.
